# voxelizer

A tool that converts a 3D model to a 3D volume, represented as a Sparse Voxel Octree, and saves the result in a file.

This code was originally part of `mdmc`, another project of mine meant to convert a 3D model to a Minecraft schematic. I've decided to modularize this part
as it could be useful for other tasks (and hopefully be useful to other people).
